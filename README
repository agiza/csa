The Content Supplier Application (CSA) is an Drupal 6 webapplication to upload, transcode, publish, maintain MediaMosa video conents and share them between different client applications.

Installation 
------------
Install the csa as a regular drupal 6 installation (see http://drupal.org/), but use the csa profile from the installation process.

Postinstall
-----------
After install or upgrade the Drupal, you can patch the htaccess file if you need/want HTTPS.

Also in the file /sites/default.settings.php (or settings.php) at the 
end there is a url you need to change (for HTTPS);

if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS'])) {
  ini_set('session.cookie_secure', 1);
  $base_url = 'https://csa.local';
}
else {
  $base_url = 'http://csa.local';
}

Change the csa.local into the URL you need for the server. You could remove the
else { ... } in most cases.
